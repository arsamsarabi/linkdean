# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Restructured `docs/` into purpose folders (`self-hosting/`, `product/`, `guides/`, `ops/`, `design/`); install split into quick start, environment, and operations.


## [0.0.2] - 2026-11-06

### Added

- Public documentation site at [docs.linkdean.app](https://docs.linkdean.app) (`apps/docs`, synced from `docs/`).
- Public marketing site at [linkdean.app](https://linkdean.app) (`apps/site`).
- Homelab public-beta deploy package (`deploy/public-beta/`) for the Nova LXD guest + Cloudflare Tunnel.
- Contributing guide, security policy, code of conduct and pull request template.
- Path-filtered release deploys on a Nova self-hosted runner.
- PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 project license (prior MIT-tagged trees remain MIT).

### Fixed

- Finishing onboarding no longer sends you straight back into it (vault setup and import again).

## [0.0.1] - 2026-11-04

### Added

- Initial release: the Docker image `ghcr.io/arsamsarabi/linkdean:0.0.1` and the install guide (now `docs/self-hosting/quick-start.md`).
